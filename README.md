Project Description: Pizza Sales Analysis
Overview:
The Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to provide insights into the sales performance of a pizza restaurant. By leveraging SQL, the project aims to analyze various aspects of pizza sales, including total revenue, most popular pizza types, order distribution, and category-wise performance. The database consists of four main tables: order_detail, orders, pizza, and pizza_types, which store information about orders, pizza details, and pizza types.

Key Objectives:
Total Orders and Revenue: Calculate the total number of orders placed and the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

Popular Pizzas: Identify the highest-priced pizza, the most common pizza size ordered, and the top 5 most ordered pizza types.

Category-wise Analysis: Determine the total quantity of each pizza category ordered and the category-wise distribution of orders.

Order Distribution: Analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day and by day of the month.

Revenue Analysis: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue and analyze cumulative revenue over time.

Advanced Insights: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

Database Schema:
order_detail: Stores details of each order, including the order ID, pizza ID, and quantity.

orders: Contains information about each order, such as the order ID, order date, and order time.

pizza: Stores details about each pizza, including the pizza ID, pizza type ID, size, and price.

pizza_types: Contains information about pizza types, including the pizza type ID, name, category, and ingredients.
